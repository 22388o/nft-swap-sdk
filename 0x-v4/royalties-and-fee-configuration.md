# Royalties and Fee Configuration

0x v4 includes extremely flexible support for fees, both royalties to creators and fees for applications and marketplaces. 0x v4 even includes multiple fee support per order, so you could split fees however you'd like! It's up to you!

NFT marketplaces can now pay royalties in real-time at a lower cost so that creators no longer have to wait days or weeks to get paid. Marketplaces also have the option to send payouts to a contract that implements custom fee disbursement logic.

**Docs coming soon. Hop into Discord if you need royalty configuration today!**
